# VaxRecords
This project provides a way to store immunization records online instead of relying on the paper cards provided by health clinics. Within this site, a parent/guardian, administrator, or verified user can create a personal account, update vaccination information, track their individual children's personal accounts and receive informative data about immunizations they might be interested in. This is a beneficial method of storing important data for families to shift from paper to paperless. Currently, vaccination forms can be multiple, disorganized and even lost for important situations. With this project, users can shift into a functional site that stores important information for them. This idea came to my mind when i was struggling to keep records of my child online instead of paperwork. Now we are working on this project as a team.
